# dev-helpers

Find inside a few helpers scripts to get you up and running with a basic suite of DevOps related tools

There is also a pre-commit sample file in the root. To install this locally run:

```cli
pre-commit install
```

The Hooks used are suitable for cross platform terraform use.

# Advanced

I have also included to the golang command to get and build the tools directly.
