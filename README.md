# dev-helpers

Created to stop repeating myself, all the tools I might need.
Find inside a few automation helpers scripts to get you up and running,
 with a basic suite of DevOps related tools.

There is also a pre-commit sample file in the root. To install this locally run:

```cli
pre-commit install
```

The Hooks used are suitable for cross platform Terraform use.

## Advanced

I have also included to the golang command to get and build the tools directly.

## lastversion

Is used in this repo and is available via PIP.
